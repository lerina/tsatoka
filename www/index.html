<article id="purpose">
<h1 id="purpose">Purpose</h1>
<p>The purpose of the game is to create a story where your PC progresses
only if you complete scenes or actions in the story that corresponds to
a real-life task or challenges.</p>
<p>For instance if the challenge is to completed a set of 9 items for
the day, then a scene or set of events in the story will move forward or
be denied depending on completion of these 9 items that must be done for
the day.</p>
<p>The 9 items could just be entries from a todo list, or it could be
more refined such as the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>First you select 3 actions to do for the day. (TODOs)</li>
<li>Next you select 3 actions <strong>not</strong> to do for the day.
(not TODO)</li>
<li>Finally you select one of 3 possibe rewards for completed tasks for
the day.
<ul>
<li>free_stuff: Its just a normal day =&gt; make the character‚Äôs
adventure progress,</li>
<li>small expense: Good job the project is done =&gt; sushi bar after
work,</li>
<li>big reward: Project Final delivery =&gt; get a new smart watch.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>The main point is to grow the story by</p>
<ul>
<li>acquiring a target in real life for the day or week,</li>
<li>define tasks to complete for this target</li>
<li>Writing down the scene and or actions to make the story
progress</li>
<li>Link each scene or actions to the real tasks to be complete.</li>

<p>Then select a name and flech out the PC with the following
questions.</p>
<pre><code>What do they do?
What do they wear?
What do they eat?
Who are the people they spend time with?
What does their daily routine look like?
What habits do they practice?
What does their life look like?
What values do you share?
What values would you like to share?
What does your role model read?
What are your role model‚Äôs hobbies?
How does your role model spend their free time?

Focus on these questions; As a PC:

    Why do I want to reinvent myself?  
    What habits and choices would I have to say yes to?  
    What habits and choices would I have to say no to?  
    Will I stay the course even when it gets rough?  </code></pre>

<article id="story">
<h1 id="sketch-a-story">Sketch a story</h1>
<p>Using the adventure premise, sketch out a story outline using a
version of <em>Harmon‚Äôs story circle</em> (eight phases modified for
RPG) that goes like this:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>You (char_gen/intro) (a character is in a zone of comfort)</li>
<li>Need (inciting incident) (but they want something)</li>
<li>Go (commitment) (they enter an unfamiliar situation)</li>
<li>Search (pinch 1) (and adapt to new situation)</li>
<li>Find (midpoint) (find what they wanted)</li>
<li>Take (pinch 2) (and pay the price)</li>
<li>Change (climax) (now capable of change)</li>
<li>Return (denouement) (and go back to where they started)</li>
</ol>
<p>Whichever scene actually resolved the start of the adventure, that‚Äôs
the climax. Having attained their climax in phase 7, that last phase -
‚ÄúReturn‚Äù - is where the PCs travel home (or to wherever their home base
is), experience is distributed, payment is made, effects are determined,
loose ends are tied, and we wind down (as a group or solo player), ready
for the next session.</p>
<p>Keeping the story circle in mind, we first start with our generated
adventure premise, and try to fill in the outline for the first three
steps of the circle.</p>
<p><strong>char in comfort zone</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><em>The PC</em>: Freelance by day. hacker by night. hustler 24/24
For fn, hustling is not just a skill its an art. It take time to craft,
practice to perfect, chance to master but thats the thrill of it. Aside
from being able to brush aside past falures and adversity, fn is not
only one who can get things done, but can make things happen. fn turns
personal pain into steping stones and a chance of progress. fn also
turns others pain into seeds of profitable solutions to apply.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Need</strong></p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p><em>The proposer</em>: The colonel sits on a park bench, erect
like a post as if still on active duty. It‚Äôs been at least one score
since he had retired. 10 years since he picked fn out of the gutter and
the dangers of the street. 7 years since he had given his proteg√© a new
life and identity. 3 year since the great betreyal, or was it?</p></li>
<li><p><em>The mission</em>: ‚Ä¶ We‚Äôre talking a risky mission here. Some
kind of extraction under extreme duress.</p></li>
<li><p><em>The incentive</em>: It turns out that the ‚Äúhostiles‚Äù are
people fn want revenge on. They are the ones that wipped out the last
tech-nomads of the old days. fn lost family and friends in that
desaster. This is why the colonel, fn‚Äôs savior and ex-mentor called this
informal meeting. Despite the confusion of the past year, the colonel
knows, in all things, fn is driven in part by the prospect of
retaliation.</p></li>
<li><p><em>The target</em>: Information. Locked away in a secure
datacenter. The documents are explosive information in the correct
hands. A game changer.</p></li>
<li><p><em>The seed</em>: The colonel got the information from an old
acquaintance. It should be ‚Äúlegit‚Äù but <em>hey!</em> people can
change.</p></li>
<li><p><em>The obstacle</em>: Space. Vast distance of desert and flat
land to cross before any hope of reaching the target.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>At this point the player accepts the mission. We enter the <em>Go
(commitment)</em> phase and as the PC prepares for the mission, the
first couple of scenes should make the PC enter an unfamiliar
situation</p>

<p>Selecting and designing challenges and activities</p>
<p>Once you have a tentative story outline, it is time to select some
real life actions, tasks and things to avoid and map it to scenes in our
story. Doing and accomplishing real stuff makes the story go
forward.</p>
<h2 id="real-activities">1. Real activities</h2>
<p>You make a list of all the tasks you have to do, big or small. Don‚Äôt
filter or organize the items you add to the list, just write it all down
in a list format.</p>
<p>As stated earlier, there are the 9 Items to take care of for the
day.</p>
<p>The PIC (Player in character) and the story progresses scene by scene
only if your POC (Player Out of Character) progresses in real life by
completing or performing the 9 specific items for the day. A real day
corresponds to a scene of the character‚Äôs adventure.</p>
<ul>
<li>First you select 3 actions to do for the day.</li>
<li>Next you select 3 actions <strong>not</strong> to do for the

<p>Momentum and consequences regardless of external factors or setbacks.
Progress on growth.</p>
<p>The big boss of baddees is ‚Ä¶ your <code>inner deceiver</code>. The
master of self-doubt and self-sabotage.</p>
<p>Subdue the inner deceiver and its five generals</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The JudgeMental What you did, what you didn‚Äôt do, what you should
have done. The eternal repetitive negative critic that consumes your
internal positivity and replaces it with out of reach external
negativity. Gets stronger each time you think you are not good enough
and lose sight of what is within your control.</p></li>
<li><p>The Victimizer The producer of excuses and drainer of willpower.
Gets stronger each time you give up or stop trying.</p></li>
<li><p>The Misguided Protector Promotes avoidance by exagerating
difficulties to even start. Fake protection from the risk of failure,
judgement or criticism. Tour ‚ÄúSafe‚Äù but Stuck. Gets stronger each time
you are paralized and don‚Äôt take any action.</p></li>
<li><p>The ringmaster Productivity guilt. Unhhealthy drive to keep
working, pleasing, saying yes. It is unsustainable and leands to
anxiety, crashes, and burnout. Unfulfilling treadmill of achievement
addiction linking your worth as a person to how productive you are. Gets
stronger each time you believe you will never be good enough or have
done enough</p></li>
<li><p>The neglector Wins then you feel insecure in your worth,
anticipate rejection. Going out of your way to seek approval. Gets
stronger each time you seek validation by prioritizing the needs of
everyone else at your own expense.</p></li>

<p>The Antidote to deceivers: Create emotional distance from the
deceiver. This make room for more rationality. This helps shifting into
an internal locus of control. How?</p>
<p>Become aware when under attack.</p>
<p>Call it out. Then <strong>choose</strong> not to listen. write down
or go through all the deceivers arguments:</p>
<ul>
<li>Safe and Stuck

<li>Is this inside my locus of control? [Y/n]</li>
<li>What first step imperfect action can I make <em>NOW</em></li>

<li>Take a break! Is it not what you do but who you are that
matters</li>
<li>Are the healthy bounderies up and active?</li>

<p>We track three things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Time spent on Deep work.</li>
<li>Commitment and consistency.</li>
<li>Real tangible results</li>
</ul>
<p>Xp represents the number of <em>Skcor</em> completed in a period of 5
days. The time spent on deep focused tasks is called <em>Skcor</em>. A
<em>Skcor</em> is a chunk or block of 20 minutes. Why <em>Skcor</em>?
Because <em>Skcor</em> <strong>rockS</strong>!</p>
<p>Hp tracks your consistency streak. Every 5 days without breaking the
chain, you add the total of Skcor to the Xp and increment the Hp by 1.
You then reset the Xp and start tracking <em>Skcor</em> for another 5
days.</p>
<p>Optionaly, since Hp are incremented 1 by 1, you can use the space to
also note the week number (or group of 5 days) and the total
<em>Skcor</em> for that week. This gives use a opportunity to also track
the progress of our ability to perform deep work.</p>
<p>Lv tracks your accomplishements. Actual non trivial work completed
such as projects and certifications ‚Ä¶ Lv is incremented each time a
‚Äúreal‚Äù project with ‚Äúreal‚Äù consequences to your life is completed.
Impactful stuff such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>getting a drivers licence</li>
<li>publishing a paper</li>
<li>create and manage an Open Source project</li>
<li>Completing and online course ‚Ä¶</li>

<p>Everything above could be seen as a productiv Everything above could
be seen as a productivity tool and story telling engine. Real life
actions are mapped to in game scenes.</p>
<p>The real gaming begins if you add Twists and turns in the unfolding
of the story. That is the story can take different directions without
real life input, thus altering the dynamics of the game. The real life
accompleshements become even more crutial, because you need all the
points you can get since you never know what unpredictable mayhem the
game can throw at the PIC (Player In Character).</p>
<h2 id="binary-ish-questions">Binary (ish) questions</h2>
<p>Actions in the Scenes can be further enriched with dynamic ingame
narratives. You ask a closed ended question and roll 1D6 and craft the
answer.</p>

<p>Tips for writing the story arc</p>
<p>The Kishotenketsu [Jp] (from qichengzhuanhe[Cn]), a time tested
storytelling structure, that predates and actually correspond to the Dan
Harmon Story Circle.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ki (Introduction):
<ol type="1">
<li>You</li>
<li>Need</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Sho (Development):
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Go</li>
<li>Search</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Ten (Twist):
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>Find</li>
<li>Take</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Ketsu (Conclusion):
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li>Return</li>
<li>Change</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<p>In a story, the following might happen:</p>
<ul>
<li>Introduction (ki): an introduction to the characters, era, and other
information required to understand the plot.</li>
<li>Development (sh≈ç): follows leads towards the twist in the story. No
major changes so far.</li>
<li>Twist (ten): the story turns toward an unexpected development. This
is the crux of the story, the yama („É§„Éû) or climax. If the narrative
takes several turns, this is the biggest one.</li>
<li>Conclusion (ketsu), also called ochi (ËêΩ„Å°) or ending, wraps up the
story.</li>
